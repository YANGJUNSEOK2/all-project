Personal notes:
I learned many things while doing this project. 
Since our plans and documents were not clean enough, we add/remove many things while project.
Because of that, in the last month of the project, when we tried to change things, we confused a lot and changed a lot of things.
I will plan all things well as possible as I can to block this situation.
